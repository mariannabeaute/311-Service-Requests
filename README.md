# 311-Service-Requests
I used Excel and Python to explore 311 Service Requests made in NYC between January 1 to December 31 2022 from top 5 zip codes with the most service requess and the bottom 5. I focused my analysis on the household income, and response time. Also, I completed a machine learning exercise where I estimated the response time for service requests based on the zip code and complaint type.
